- 👋 Hi, I’m @AstroPastor
- 👀 I’m interested in Astrophotography, telescopes, programming, arduino, ASCOM and electronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code and create drivers for my astronomy equipment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a simple arduino based driver to control a stepper motor driven Dobsonian Telescope tracking platform and that can be guided using PHD2 software.
- 📫 I can be reached via GITHUB...I think? I am a total noobie!
